## How to Update Interior Pages:

#### Add Sub header
Add text to `<div class="head-image__subheader"></div>`

#### Add Background Image to header
Add `style="background-image: url( YOUR FILE PATH HERE )"` to `<div class="head-image inner-page">`. It should end up looking similar to: `<div class="head-image inner-page" style="background-image: url( /images/headers/mission-header.jpg )">`

# Style guides

### LESS style guide
[ilite style guide] (https://github.com/GailDrake/ilite/wiki/Less-Style-guide) - A short, but authoritative style guide. Memorize it. Follow it. Teach it to your friends.

[Airbnb CSS Style Guide] (https://github.com/airbnb/css) - A very well written and comprehensive guide to CSS and Sass. We're using Less, but they're basically the same. For any conflicts with the ilite style guide, this loses.


### Javascript style guide
[Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide] (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) - Great general guidelines, and the style guide I've been seeing many companies use lately.


#### Note:
Do not write in any `*.css` files. They are being generated by `*.less` files and will be written over. 

#### Angular.js guide
All members will be stored in a javascript array of objects and iterated through using Angular.
