                    <h2>Subteam Specific Mission Statement</h2><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> To be able to create an efficient and robust robot that represents the whole of our abilities and capabilities as a subteam and serves as a base for other subteams’ work. In the process, we would like to maintain a priority for safety, control, and an appreciation for quality design. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

									<div class="team-img"><img src="../images/members/Build/Build.jpg"></div>
                  <p>The Build Subteam is responsible for creating the ILITE robot yearly for competition. To do so efficiently and effectively, the subteam has split into several smaller branches: the Drive Train Team, Manipulator Team, and CAD and Integration Team. The Drive Train Team takes on the role of developing the foundation of the team’s robot each season. This includes responsibility for all major structural members as well as the design and construction of a drive train layout optimized for that season’s FRC challenge. Students and mentors work side by side discussing game strategies and best practices to ensure a successful robot which will last through an entire season. The Manipulator Team is responsible for the design of complex components such as arms, claws, and shooters that attach to the drivetrain to allow the robot to successfully tackle the team’s goals each year as either an offensive, defensive, or equally-balanced robot. This team undergoes a long process of prototyping and experimentation before settling on the final product which they execute with precise manufacturing techniques. The CAD and Integration Team models the entire robot and design process through its various stages in OpenSCAD and Inventor to ensure good team documentation and to create engineering drawings for manufacturing. This is important as it allows the team to construct a second “practice” robot that is identical to the competition robot. It also helps ensure that all parts come together in a seamless package which adheres to FIRST design regulations.</p>

                    <h2>Subteam Specific Mission Statement</h2><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> To inspire people, young and old, to become leaders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by providing them with the proper environment, social encouragement to pursue STEM, and necessary resources and mentoring to continue learning and working in STEM in and out of school environments. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

                  <p>The ILITE Outreach Team is a complex network of people that work to exercise the skills needed for successful project management, advertising, and marketing. Made up of dedicated team members that meet multiple times a week, the Outreach Team is open to all students interested in outreach and all things business-related. The team breaks off into multiple divisions that focus on certain aspects of outreach and are categorized into specialized areas of interest such as Engineering Inspiration & Outreach and Awards Submissions -- both of which contribute towards supporting the mission and vision of the team. The Engineering Inspiration (EI) team takes part in the development of our outreach and pushes the boundaries of what defines a “robotics team”. The EI Team coordinates and organizes the participation in outreach events such as our Haymaker STEM Expo and a variety of annual summer camps. All of our work in these events are what set ILITE apart, and the Awards subteam works to demonstrate that to FIRST. The Awards team focuses on which awards can and will be sought after for the season and develop a strategy for each. These skills that are developed within the team promote and enhance the opportunities and abilities of each student to reach success, especially in a small business environment. The entire team focuses on the bigger picture for ILITE, while the members of the Outreach team work to expand the opportunities and mindset for the community and its members, promoting the development and growth of FIRST.</p>

                    <h2>Subteam Specific Mission Statement</h2><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> To be able to create an efficient electronics board that represents our electronic capabilities. In the process of doing this we want to make a board that is safe, neat, and working. <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

                  <p>The Electronics subteam’s main task is to efficiently route and connect the necessary components needed for the robot to function. These include talons, roboRIO, power distribution panel (PDP), and the voltage regulator module (VRM). Other components called sensors each serve a unique function to the robot. Each year, our robot uses a multitude of sensors to help the robot record data to allow it to perform as expected on the field. We use multiple different types of wires that vary in gauge size to connect all of these components. While doing this, we learn many useful concepts such as space management and labeling. Throughout the years, we have used these major concepts by routing the wires together onto the electronics board in the most efficient way for us to track the flow of electricity. This year, we were able to use 3-D printing to assist us with customized casings for not only our ports but our components, which in turn made our electronics board much neater and safer. Along with ensuring that the robot has all the appropriate sensors, talons, and other components, the Electronics Team is responsible for creating a functional pneumatic setup. In this setup, our robot works with a compressor that generates air which flows through pneumatic tubing through multiple regulators that will eventually be used to activate the moving parts of the robot. Lastly, our Electronics subteam must be able to effectively explain the purpose and concepts of each component to other members of our robotics, such as programming to allow their code to work, as well as interested members of the community and potential future members..</p>

                  <p>Team 1885, ILITE Robotics, is defined by an intellectual and creative legacy built upon the impressionable, diligent, and ambitious minds of our members. With as many as members as we have, the most effective and efficient team structure became a division into subteams with designated mentors and student leaders running each. Of these subteams, Graphic Design gives life to ILITE through detailed and creative imagery including thematically appropriate designs. Graphics continuously collaborates with other subteams, including but not limited to, Build, Chairman’s, its own branch of photography/videography, and Web Design. Along with the creation of many logos and posters, the Graphics team designs a yearly summary of our organization’s accomplishments, history, and the progress of our robot, called the annual report. Finding the inspiration and motivation behind a design is not always easy, but the members of our brilliant Graphics Design team seem to be constantly overflowing with these qualities. Each year, Graphics becomes a tightly knit group of friends, each member going out of their way to support and encourage each other in every endeavor, whether big or small, simple or complex. One word that the Graphics team unequivocally embodies above all else is “dedication”. The Graphics team strives to apply maximum effort in every task in order to effectively communicate a design’s message. It’s easy to see how much passion and zeal the Graphics team translates from imaginative ideas to a vast array of gorgeous projects, displayed with pride and a sense of accomplishment.</p>

                  <p>The Programming Team is primarily put in charge of developing and writing code for the robot. Additionally, members of the Programming Team help with other coding projects, such as developing mobile applications and working on the team's website. Most of our time is spent focusing on developing necessary algorithms and testing these algorithms to allow smooth operation of the robot both autonomously and in driver operation mode. This includes, but is not limited to, writing code for object tracking through the use of a camera mounted on the robot, reading and interpreting data from both analog and digital inputs, and outputting the proper data to the robot for actions independent of human interaction and to provide clean and consistent movements that the drivers can always rely on. Over the years, ILITE’s robot code has garnered respect and acknowledgement for the successful code structure. All in all, the Programming Team has a long history of pushing the bounds of what a robot can achieve.</p>

                  <p>The website development subteam develops the website for our team. Through time, dedication, and collaboration with the use of GitHub, we ensu re that the website is of high quality. Our site has also been acknowledged by our many FIRST website awards over the years. Our main subteam goal is to better represent the team to the general public by providing a way for people all over the world to identify the various ways that ILITE stands out. We use our website as a way to teach people about the benefits of participating in Cyber Security, Sustainability, and FIRST Robotics. It is also our duty to attract attention to STEM and FIRST to prepare the next generation of young minds to take on the various challenges of the future to improve the community. We believe that by maintaining a high quality website and keeping the community updated, we can influence people of all ages to participate in FIRST and its various programs, such as FLL, FTC, and FRC. By attracting more attention to FIRST with our website, we can better prepare the young minds of the community to pursue STEM-related fields such as engineering, website development, computer science, electronics, graphical design, and business. We optimize internet communication to keep the community updated on the various affairs of the team, such as participating in competitions and displaying our various awards. As well as keeping the community updated, we provide better support for the community through the institutionalization of various STEM endeavors, through means of summer camps and the distribution of media.</p>
